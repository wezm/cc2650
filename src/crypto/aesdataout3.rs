For a Host read operation, these registers contain the 128-bit output block from the latest AES operation. Reading from a word-aligned offset within this address range will read one word (4 bytes) of data out the 4-word deep (16 bytes = 128-bits AES block) data output buffer. The words (4 words, one full block) should be read before the core will move the next block to the data output buffer. To empty the data output buffer, AESCTL.OUTPUT_RDY must be written. For the modes with authentication (CBC-MAC, GCM and CCM), the invalid (message) bytes/words can be written with any data. Note: The AAD / authentication only data is not copied to the output buffer but only used for authentication."]
